## Purpose:
Create an analysis of temperature trends specifically for the months of June and December.

## Results:
- Avg Temp in the June is about 4<sup>o</sup>F warmer than Dec
- The minimum temperature for December is 8<sup>o</sup>F colder than June
- The max temperature for June is only 2<sup>o</sup>F warmer than December

## Summary:
Overall the temperatures in Hawaii are relatively stable year round with more likelihood of colder temperatures as low as 56<sup>o</sup>F durring December, as oposed to 64<sup>o</sup>F in June. There is some preliminary data on precipitation over the years of data that gives an idea of what the rainfall is like. It may be a good idea to do more of a month by month compairison of June rainfall compaired to December rainfall and pair that with the temperature compairison. It would also be worthwhile to try to gather information on the number of sunny, cloudy, and rainy days for the two months. This can give you an idea of how many days you might expect higher amounts of business and will tell you how strong the rains may be when they roll in, indicating the intensity of the storms.
